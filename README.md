# JSS-Splash-EULA

This script is designed to run in macOS at the moment. It could be updated to run on Windows though.
It looks up the default file locations for the JSS, makes a backup of the original files, 
then updates the CSS and HTML files to give you a header and EULA popup message at login. 

There is a place holder for Windows and Linux preperation if I ever get around to updating the script to work there.
